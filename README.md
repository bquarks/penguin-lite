# Penguin-lite

Penguin-lite is a just-css version of penguin, without any component scripting, useful for app scaffolding.
Visit [penguin site](http://penguin.docs.bqws.io/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/bq/penguin) for documentation.

Note:
This [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), in the future we may consider publishing penguin-lite as bower package.
